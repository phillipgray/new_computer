Congrats! You've got a new computer. This also means you've got a brand-new adult yak to shave as you set up your new box. Or maybe a herd of yaks.

Let's make that easier with a checklist of all the steps. (In the future, this may even be an automated script. But unless you start balling out on a laptop often, this may not be the best use of time.)

## The Basics
- (Optional; needed for a new linux box) Install zsh shell
- Install oh-my-zsh
  - Add the my-bira theme included in this repo
  - Enable the z plugin for to make the rapid folder jumping happen
- Install version managers for:
  - ruby with rbenv
  - python with pyenv
  - node with nodenv
